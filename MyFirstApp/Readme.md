Welcome to this C# application!

C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft that is commonly used for building Windows applications and modern web applications. It is a statically-typed, object-oriented language that is powerful and easy to learn.

In this application, you will find some basic examples of C# code that demonstrate how to use the language to perform various tasks. This includes working with variables, using loops and conditional statements, and interacting with user input.

To run these examples, you will need to have the .NET framework installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the framework from the Microsoft website.

We hope that these examples will help you get started with C# and encourage you to explore the language further. Good luck on your C# journey!
