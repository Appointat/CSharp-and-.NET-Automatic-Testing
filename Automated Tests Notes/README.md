# Introduction

They are designed to be executed automatically by software rather than manually by a human tester. As for applications, they are widely used in software development and quality assurance (QA) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of testing.

1. `Unit tests`: These tests are used to test individual units of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they behave as expected. 
2. `Integration tests`: These tests are used to verify the interaction between different units of code or systems, and to ensure they integrate correctly.
3. `Functional tests`: These tests are used to test the functionality of the software from the perspective of the end user, to ensure the software meets the specified requirements.
4. `Performance tests`: These tests are used to evaluate the performance of the software under different conditions, such as varying workloads or network conditions.
5. `Regression tests`: These tests are used to ensure that changes made to the software do not break existing functionality.
