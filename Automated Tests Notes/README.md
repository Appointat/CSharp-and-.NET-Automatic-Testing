# Automated Tests

# Introduction

They are designed to be executed automatically by software rather than manually by a human tester. As for applications, they are widely used in software development and quality assurance (QA) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of testing.

1. `Unit tests`: These tests are used to test individual units of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they behave as expected. 
2. `Integration tests`: These tests are used to verify the interaction between different units of code or systems, and to ensure they integrate correctly.
3. `Functional tests`: These tests are used to test the functionality of the software from the perspective of the end user, to ensure the software meets the specified requirements.
4. `Performance tests`: These tests are used to evaluate the performance of the software under different conditions, such as varying workloads or network conditions.
5. `Regression tests`: These tests are used to ensure that changes made to the software do not break existing functionality.

## **Why Do Automated Tests Matter?**

Automated tests enable **fast error feedback** on the code developed, making the **development process more reliable**. In other words, developers can see errors quickly and fix them before software goes into production.

Automated testing is also useful when integrating new features into your software. 

- When the integration of features is being done, the written tests can ascertain探明 which parts of the software will break after the integration.
- Otherwise, if the tests are done manually, the team would need to test the integration at least three times: in a new feature created, in an old feature integrated, and in between both parts.

Testing manually is not only **time-consuming耗时的**, but it's also **error-prone易错的**. 

So, developing an application driven by automated tests can provide many benefits, including:

1. Quality control: we know what to expect from the software’s behavior.
2. Clear documentation: well-written tests are a good way to document software features.
3. Long-term value: even if you have to expend more effort up front to develop automated tests, you'll gain long-term dividends.
4. Time back: the more the tests are run, the more time they save you.
5. Energy back: the longer the lifecycle of a project, the more important automated tests become.
